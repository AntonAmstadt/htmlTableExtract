# htmlTableExtract
I wrote this program to save me from having to manually write down all 676 bigrams and their percentage frequencies.

Takes a specific set of html table data from input.txt, extracts the useful information, and puts it into outputBigrams.txt. The output is a file with the frequency of all of the bigrams (in percentage) of English letters from a set of publications. 

input.txt is the content of a single HTML table element from https://norvig.com/mayzner.html. The table from the linked website is presented visually, which is nice to look at, but I need the data stored in a file so I can later use the data in a program to break a simple substitution cipher.
